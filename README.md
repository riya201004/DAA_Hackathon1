# DAA_Hackathon1

We are arranging tasks based on urgency [Yes('y') first] in the list sorted_urgent_list to ensure we allot urgent tasks first.
In the same list we have further sorted based on importance of each task (1 being the highest).
Available slots(available_slots) are taken on the assumption that the company's working hours are from 9 am to 6 pm.
Based on the deadlines we have alloted the slots by modifying the algorithm of Job Sequencing.
After allotment of a job we have shown the available slots.
